# CTF Challenges
## 1. üõ°Ô∏è CTF Participant - GSU Technology Immersion Challenge (Sponsored by Truist)

In November 2024, I participated in the GSU Technology Immersion Challenge (CTF) sponsored by Truist, competing as part of Team **CipherSoldiers** . We achieved a 10th place ranking out of 27 teams, solving 8 out of 10 challenges and earning 4,525 points.

This CTF involved a range of categories that enhanced my cybersecurity skills, below is a list of challenges my team and I solved in the CTF event, along with brief descriptions:

1. **[Mathematricks (Pwn, Very Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/pwn/%5BVery%20Easy%5D%20Mathematricks)**  
   A binary exploitation challenge where we reverse-engineered the program‚Äôs logic to bypass security checks using basic arithmetic tricks and buffer manipulation.

2. **[El Pipo (Pwn, Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/pwn/%5BEasy%5D%20El%20Pipo)**  
   This pwn challenge involved analyzing a binary to find vulnerabilities in its handling of input data, which allowed us to execute commands and gain access to restricted functionality.

3. **[CryptOfTheUndead (Reversing, Very Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/rev/%5BVery%20Easy%5D%20CryptOfTheUndead)**  
   A basic reversing challenge where we disassembled the binary to understand and decode encrypted messages, revealing critical flags hidden within the undead-themed program.

4. **[Sp00ky Theme (Forensics, Very Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/forensics/%5BVery%20Easy%5D%20Sp00ky%20Theme)**  
   This forensics challenge required analyzing metadata and hidden content in multimedia files to extract spooky-themed secrets and hidden flags.

5. **[The Shortcut Haunting (Forensics, Very Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/forensics/%5BVery%20Easy%5D%20The%20Shortcut%20Haunting)**  
   In this challenge, we examined shortcut files (.lnk) and file artifacts to trace a haunted path, leading to concealed files and the final flag.

6. **[Forbidden Manuscript (Forensics, Very Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/forensics/%5BVery%20Easy%5D%20Forbidden%20Manuscript)**  
   By analyzing text files and their encodings, we uncovered hidden messages within a manuscript that guided us to the flag location.

7. **[Sugar Free Candies (Crypto, Very Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/crypto/%5BVery%20Easy%5D%20sugar%20free%20candies)**  
   This crypto challenge involved decrypting a simple cipher related to Halloween candies, where we used frequency analysis and standard cryptographic techniques to reveal the message.

8. **[Sekur Julius (Crypto, Very Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/crypto/%5BVery%20Easy%5D%20sekur%20julius)**  
   A Caesar cipher variant, requiring us to identify and apply shifts correctly to uncover the hidden flag within the encrypted text.

9. **[Brevi Moduli (Crypto, Very Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/crypto/%5BVery%20Easy%5D%20brevi%20moduli)**  
   Using modular arithmetic, we decrypted messages encoded with a basic RSA setup, practicing our skills in modular inverses and factorization.

10. **[Hybrid Unifier (Crypto, Easy)](https://github.com/hackthebox/hacktheboo-2024/tree/main/crypto/%5BEasy%5D%20hybrid%20unifier)**  
    This challenge combined symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes, where we worked to analyze the hybrid encryption process and reverse-engineer it to reveal the flag.



## 2. üõ°Ô∏è Level Effect CTF Challenge - National Cybersecurity Competition (July 2024)
I participated in the Level Effect CTF Challenge, a national cybersecurity competition designed around real-world scenarios. Competing in categories like cryptography, web security, incident response, and OSINT, I achieved a 360th rank with a score of 2400 points. This experience further enhanced my practical skills in cybersecurity.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
VirusTotal for malware analysis
Wireshark for network packet analysis
Cryptography
